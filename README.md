# Investment Website Prototype

Welcome to the Investment Website Prototype!  
This project is an early-stage investment website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is currently a non-responsive prototype designed to showcase the core structure and features of an investment platform.

## Features

- **Landing Page:** Introduction to the investment platform.
- **Investment Options:** Displays various investment products and plans.
- **Basic UI Components:** Navigation bar, cards, and buttons.
- **Client-Side Interactivity:** Some dynamic behaviors using JavaScript (e.g., toggling views, showing/hiding sections).
- **Simple Styling:** Uses CSS for layout, colors, and basic visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Status

> **Prototype only**: This site is still in development.  
> - **No responsiveness**: The layout is fixed and does not adapt to different screen sizes or mobile devices yet.
> - **No backend**: All data is static and handled client-side.
> - **No authentication or real investment features**: This is a UI/UX demo.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/caleboss20/Investment-website.git
